Edit t_clips variable with the video intervals (in seconds) that you want and the program automatically cuts and join the clips

TO RUN THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE MOVIEPY INSTALLED 

In the code I imported "palabrotas.mp4" video and I pick 2 to 6 seconds, 10 to 15 and 20 to 25.

No matter how many intervals you put, it works with just 1 interval or multiple intervals
